Comment Danny DELCAMBRE

We should have a formal procedure in place to be informed about changes to the ISO currency code list.
Ideal solution would probably to register for ISO notifications at this address: https://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/amendments/newsletter.html. 
Instead of having one or more person(s) registering, we could register as swg@sdmx.org
