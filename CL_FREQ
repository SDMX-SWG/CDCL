B	en	Daily - business week	Similar to "daily", however there are no observations for Saturday and Sunday (so, neither "missing values" nor "numeric values" should be provided for Saturday and Sunday). This treatment ("business") is one way to deal with such cases, but it is not the only option. Such a time series could alternatively be considered daily ("D"), thus, with missing values in the weekend

N	en	Minutely	While N denotes "minutely", usually, there may be no observations every minute (for several series the frequency is usually "irregular" within a day/days). And though observations may be sparse (not collected every minute), missing values do not need to be given for the minutes when no observations exist: in any case the time stamp determines when an observation is observed	PT1M
C	en	Continuous	The item is updated more frequent than daily	
_O	en	Other	The event occurs with another type of regularity (for instance, every leap year).
