This treatment ("business") is one way to deal with such cases, but it is not the only option. Such a time series could alternatively be considered daily ("D"), thus, with missing values in the weekend

PT1M	        N	    en	    Minutely	While N denotes "minutely", usually, there may be no observations every minute (for several series the frequency is usually "irregular" within a day/days). And though observations may be sparse (not collected every minute), missing values do not need to be given for the minutes when no observations exist: in any case the time stamp determines when an observation is observed
	            C	    en	    Continuous	              The item is updated more frequent than daily
              _O	  en	    Other	                    The event occurs with another type of regularity (for instance, every leap year).

              CU	  en	    Continuously updated    	The event repeats without interruption.

Note from joint meeting:
  . not change the Schemas
  . use ISO duration notation (2010-M01/P2M or 2010-01/P2M for calendar year)
  or
  . normal period notation (2010-M01, 2010-M03 but not 2010-M02 for every two months)
  . first obs in the time series would specify the starting point for validation
  . try to align the freq codes with the iso codes if possible

Question from SWG physical meeting:
  Should code V be "Never updated" or "One-off"?
