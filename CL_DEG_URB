Here are our comments:

Name: remove "(residence)"

Definition: The degree of urbanisation is based on a combination of geographical contiguity and population density (for more info: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/degree-of-urbanisation/methodology)

In our degree of urbanisation typology we use the concept of "Urban areas" as the aggregation of cities with town and suburbs, so using "Urban areas" would be a source of great confusion.

We therefore suggest:

Code    Name                   Description

CIT     Cities                 Densely populated areas
SUBURB  Towns and suburb       Intermediate density areas
RUR     Rural areas            Thinly populated areas

This proposal is also in line with "A recommendation on the method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical comparisons" prepared by the EU, ILO, FAO, OECD, UN-Habitat and World Bank) and submitted to the UN Statistical Commission in March 2020: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/system/files/bg-item3j-recommendation-e.pdf

P.S.: We will also need an entry in the SDMX Glossary.
